# Password-Generator
This project is about using the skills we learned and applying it to javascript.
We have tp use our knowledge of if and else statements to get the results we want.
I want to be able to get prompts of how long and what type of random password we want to generate.
I made a prompt asking how many characters the user wanted to use.
A minimum of 8 and no mare than 128.
I also gave prompts for lowercase and uppercase options.
I also gave prompts for using symbols if the user wanted.
